A useful utility for my datapacks

Currently there are 6 modules, Randomizer, Teleportor, NBT manipulator, Light Detector, Math API, Identification API.  
- Randomizer module is a flexible random number generator, capable of generate a random number within custom range.  
- Teleportor module is a tp command that take a scoreboard as an input, very useful if you don't know the location that you want to teleport to before hand.  
- NBT manipulator module is a flexible /data modify that use scoreboard as an input. capable of insert an element into array, reallocate array size, replace an element in array, etc.
- Not-so-flexible skylight detector that can get the current brightness at the entity  
- Math API contain many useful math functions such as sin(), acos(), atan2(), etc.
- Identification API (Id API) is a shortcut for create an uuid system.
